[features]
# Enable features only available with full standard library support. This
# includes:
# - a heap allocator backend for MockRt (useful for platforms that don't have
#   stack frame allocator assembly written)
std = []

# Enable features only available when compiling on a nightly toolchain. This is
# a flag for features that are "unconditionally better" and which do not
# influence the overall behavior of the library meaningfully. Configuration
# options that don't meet these constraints should get their own feature flags.
#
# As of now, this includes:
# - generating #[doc(cfg( attributes to document that some items are only
#   available when certain features are selected:
nightly = []

# Dangerous flags, for evaluation purposes only. Setting either of these flags
# requires the `unsound` feature flag. We don't enforce this dependency here,
# instead we produce a compile error when it is not set.
